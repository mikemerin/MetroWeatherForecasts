# README

This is an application used to help with forms for Metro Weather. Section 1 are the LIFTs, section 2 are the TIDES.

Please try to only use this application once a day in the morning runs as there is a limit to how many times the application can make calls to the forecasting service.

This is meant to be a base forecast; please do research on your own to fine-tune the forecasts as you see fit.

Simply copy the data you wish to use, then paste them into your word document by highlighting all boxes and then pasting at `"Keep Text Only (T)"`.
