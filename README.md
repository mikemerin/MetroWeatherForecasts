# Form Generator

This is an application used to help with forms for Metro Weather. The first 6 pages are for LIFT forms and the last page is for TIDES.

The LIFT forms are valid for the day you open the page on, the TIDES will point to the next Sunday (or the current Sunday if you're doing it the day of).

# Important Note

Please try to only use this application **once a day in the morning** during the morning rush as there is a limit to how many times the application can make calls to the forecasting service. Every time the page loads it makes 14 calls, one for each forecast/tide station.

This is meant to be a base forecast; please do research on your own to fine-tune the forecasts as you see fit.

# Instructions

Use Chrome and download this extension:

Once you do that, you can simply right-click on the table and choose "copy table".

Open up the word document and highlight all cells (or for Tides, highlight all but the wind/wave/visibility column), then right-click to paste and voila!
